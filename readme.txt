== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How does the one-time login link work?

When the 'Send Login Link' button is clicked, a unique token is generated and stored in the user meta.
The login link is then generated by appending the user ID and token as query parameters to the WordPress login URL.
When the login link is clicked, the plugin validates the token and logs in the user if the token is valid.
Can I customize the email template?

Yes, you can customize the email template by modifying the 'tamplate/email.php' file in the plugin directory.
You can use the '[link]' placeholder in the template, which will be replaced with the generated login link.
